Option 5: "The Data Reality Check: Why Your ML Timeline Just Doubled"
Slide 1: The Uncomfortable Question
Visual: Iceberg with "ML Model" as tip, massive "Data Work" below water
Content:

Top stat: "80% of ML project time is data preparation"
Question: "Why does my 2-week ML project take 6 months?"
Answer: "It's not about the model..."
Bottom: Real project times from Aladdin ML initiatives

Speaking Notes:
"Let me start with a confession that'll save you months of frustration. When engineers estimate ML projects, they're usually estimating the fun part - building the model. That's like estimating home construction time based on how long it takes to put on the roof. Today, I'm going to show you what's really hiding in your ML timeline, why data preparation is the real beast, and most importantly, how to spot whether your data is ready for ML before you commit to that ambitious deadline. This knowledge will make you a hero in planning meetings."

Slide 2: A Day in the Life of Your Data
Visual: Comic strip showing data's journey from source to model
Content:
Panel 1: "The Promise"

"We have 5 years of trading data!"

Panel 2: "The Discovery"

30% missing values
Date formats: 5 different types
Customer IDs: Changed format in 2023

Panel 3: "The Archaeology"

"Why is volume negative?"
"What happened on March 15th?"
"Who decided NULL means zero?"

Panel 4: "The Negotiation"

5 different data owners
3 approval processes
2 systems that don't talk

Panel 5: "The Reality"

Usable data: 6 months worth
Time spent: 3 months
Tears shed: Countless

Bottom text: "This is based on true events"
Speaking Notes:
"This isn't comedy - this is documentary. Last month, a team came to me: 'We have 10 years of portfolio data, let's predict performance!' Fantastic, let's look. First problem: data format changed three times. Different teams used different customer identifiers. Some genius decided that -999 means 'missing value' but forgot to document it. My favorite: discovered that before 2022, 'buy' and 'sell' were sometimes swapped in the database. Three months later, we had 18 months of actually usable data. The model? Built that in a week. This is why your timeline doubled - we're not building models, we're doing data archaeology."

Slide 3: The Data Quality Reality Check

Content:
Your Data Health Checkup:
SymptomWhat It MeansTime Impact"It's in multiple systems"3+ weeks of integration+6 weeks"We'll need to talk to compliance"Data privacy reviews+4 weeks"Format changed last year"Historical data cleanup+3 weeks"Sometimes the field is empty"Missing value strategy needed+2 weeks"We calculate that differently now"Business logic reconciliation+4 weeks"John knows how it works"Undocumented tribal knowledge+3 weeks
Real Example: Risk Metrics Prediction

Initial timeline: 1 month
Data issues discovered: All of the above
Actual delivery: 5 months
Model building time: 1 week

The Universal Truth:
"If someone says 'the data is ready,' it's not ready"
Speaking Notes:
"Think of this as a medical chart for your data. Each symptom adds weeks to your timeline. 'It's in multiple systems' - that's not just copying files. That's three teams arguing about which system is the source of truth, different update schedules, incompatible formats. My personal favorite: 'John knows how it works.' John is always either on vacation, just left the company, or speaks in riddles. We had a critical project dependent on understanding a risk calculation. Only John knew the formula. John retired. We spent a month reverse-engineering his Excel macros. This chart isn't pessimistic - it's based on 50+ Aladdin ML projects. Add up your symptoms, multiply by 1.5 for safety."

Slide 4: The "Is Your Data ML-Ready?" Test

Content:
Quick Assessment: Score Your Data
ðŸŸ¢ Green Light (Start Tomorrow)

Single system source
100K+ clean records
Clear documentation
Fields rarely change
<5% missing values
You own the data

ðŸŸ¡ Yellow Light (Add 2 Months)

2-3 system sources
10K+ records but messy
Some documentation exists
Occasional format changes
5-20% missing values
Need approval from 1-2 teams

ðŸ”´ Red Light (Reconsider Project)

4+ systems involved
<1K usable records
No documentation
Frequent logic changes


20% missing values


Multiple approval layers

Case Study: Trade Anomaly Detection

Started as Red (6 systems, no docs)
4 months to get to Yellow
2 months to get to Green
Then 2 weeks to build model

Speaking Notes:
"This is your go/no-go decision framework. Green light data? Rare as unicorns, but when you have it, move fast. Yellow light is where 70% of projects live - doable but budget extra time. Red light? I've seen teams waste years here. Our trade anomaly system started deep in red - data spread across six systems, each with their own definition of 'anomaly.' We spent four months just agreeing on what an anomaly was. If you're in red, either fix the data first as a separate project, or find a different problem to solve. Harsh but true: bad data kills more ML projects than bad models."

Slide 5: The Hidden Data Landmines
Visual: Mine field with warning flags
Content:
Data Problems That Will Explode Your Timeline:
1. The Time Bomb ðŸ’£

Training on future data you won't have in production
Example: Using settlement data to predict trades (settles 2 days later)

2. The Shape-Shifter ðŸŽ­

Business logic that changes but looks the same
Example: "Revenue" calculation changed in 2023, field name didn't

3. The Survivor Bias ðŸ‘»

Only seeing successful outcomes in historical data
Example: Only having data on funded loans, not rejected ones

4. The Holiday Surprise ðŸŽ„

Patterns that break on weekends/holidays
Example: Volume prediction model fails every Monday

5. The Denominator Drama âž—

Ratios where denominator can be zero
Example: Profit margin when revenue = 0

Each landmine adds 2-4 weeks of debugging
Speaking Notes:
"These are the project killers that no one warns you about. The time bomb - we built a beautiful model predicting trade success using settlement data. Worked perfectly in testing. Production? We don't have settlement data until 2 days after we need the prediction. Three months wasted. The shape-shifter got us last year - 'customer value' meant lifetime revenue until 2023, then it changed to annual revenue. Same field name, completely different meaning. Model accuracy dropped 40% overnight. Survivor bias is everywhere in finance - we only have data on trades that completed, loans that were approved, customers who stayed. Your model learns from winners only, then fails on everything else. Check for these now, not after three months of work."

Slide 6: The Minimum Viable Dataset
Visual: Building blocks showing data requirements
Content:
What You Actually Need to Start:
Foundation Layer (Must Have):

10,000+ examples minimum
6 months of consistent data
Core features (5-10 fields that matter)
Clear success/failure labels

Enhancement Layer (Can Add Later):

Additional features
Longer history
External data sources
Real-time feeds

Example: Customer Churn Prediction
Start With:
âœ“ Customer ID
âœ“ Monthly activity (6 months)
âœ“ Account age
âœ“ Product type
âœ“ Churn flag

Add Later:
+ Transaction details
+ Support tickets
+ Market data
+ Social sentiment
The 80/20 Rule:
"80% of model performance comes from 20% of your data"
Pro Tip: Start with the minimum, prove value, then enhance
Speaking Notes:
"Everyone thinks they need perfect, complete data to start ML. Wrong. You need the minimum viable dataset - just enough to prove the concept works. Think of it like building an MVP product. Our customer churn model started with just five fields. Five! Got us to 75% accuracy. Then we added transaction patterns - up to 82%. Support ticket sentiment - 84%. Diminishing returns kicked in fast. We spent 2 weeks on the basic model, then 3 months adding features for a 9% improvement. Start simple, show value, then iterate. This approach also means you can show progress in weeks, not months. CFO loves that."

Slide 7: Your Data Reality Survival Guide
Visual: Roadmap/checklist hybrid
Content:
Before You Promise Any ML Timeline:
Week 1: Data Reality Check
â–¡ List all data sources needed
â–¡ Check actual data volume (not theoretical)
â–¡ Find the data owners
â–¡ Look at 100 random records
â–¡ Count the missing values
â–¡ Check for documentation
Your Go/No-Go Decision Points:

Have 10K+ clean records? â†’ Proceed
Can get data without Legal? â†’ Proceed
Pattern stable for 6+ months? â†’ Proceed
Any "No"? â†’ Fix data first

Timeline Multipliers (Be Honest):

Perfect data (rare): Timeline x1
Typical enterprise data: Timeline x2.5
Multiple systems: Timeline x3
Regulated data: Timeline x4

Your New Vocabulary:

Replace: "The data is ready"
With: "We need 4 weeks for data preparation"

The Golden Rule:
"Budget 80% time for data, 20% for modeling"
Final Wisdom: "Bad data is not a model problem, it's a business problem"
Speaking Notes:
"This is your insurance policy against timeline disasters. That Week 1 checklist? Non-negotiable. I don't care how urgent the project is - spend that week understanding your data reality. Looking at 100 random records will teach you more than any documentation. You'll find that customer IDs that should be numbers have letters, dates are in American format half the time and European the other half, and someone's been entering 'NULL' as text instead of leaving fields empty. The timeline multipliers aren't pessimistic - they're realistic. Use them in planning and watch your credibility soar when you actually deliver on time. Remember: every successful ML project is built on a foundation of clean, understood, accessible data. Everything else is just math."
