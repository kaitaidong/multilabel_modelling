Complete Pipeline Architecture
Phase 1: Autoencoder Pre-training

Simple Dense Architecture: 3-layer encoder/decoder with bottleneck
Robust Preprocessing: Handles mixed data types and missing values
All Data Training: Uses both labeled and unlabeled data for representation learning
Early Stopping & Learning Rate Scheduling: Prevents overfitting

Phase 2: Classification Head Training

Frozen Encoder: Preserves learned representations
Multi-output Head: Sigmoid outputs for each field
Separate Training: Only trains classification layers
Validation Monitoring: Tracks classification performance

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
1. Comprehensive Data Handling

Mixed Data Types: Numerical + categorical features
Missing Data: Simple imputation strategies
Realistic Patterns: Financial domain-specific synthetic data
Scalable Preprocessing: Fit once, transform consistently

2. Strong Baseline Comparisons

Random Forest: Traditional ML baseline
Simple Neural Network: Direct neural network without autoencoder
Fair Comparison: Same preprocessing for all models
Multiple Metrics: Hamming loss, exact match, macro accuracy

3. Detailed Analysis & Visualization

Training Histories: Loss/accuracy curves for both phases
Reconstruction Quality: Analysis of autoencoder performance
Encoding Analysis: Statistics and visualizations of learned representations
Performance Comparison: Visual and numerical comparisons

4. Production-Ready Code

Modular Design: Clean separation of concerns
Error Handling: Robust to various data conditions
Reproducible: Fixed random seeds throughout
Well-Documented: Clear function descriptions and workflow

ðŸ’¡ What This Baseline Establishes
Proof of Concept

Does autoencoder pre-training help? - Clear comparison with baselines
Is the pipeline working? - End-to-end functionality
Are representations meaningful? - Reconstruction and encoding analysis
Is it worth the complexity? - Performance vs traditional methods

Foundation for Advanced Work

Preprocessing Pipeline: Reusable for advanced architectures
Evaluation Framework: Consistent metrics for comparison
Data Handling: Robust handling of real-world data issues
Architecture Template: Easy to extend with advanced techniques

ðŸš€ Expected Outcomes
If Autoencoder Wins:

Validates Approach: Pre-training on unlabeled data helps
Ready for Advanced: Can proceed with VAEs, attention, fine-tuning
Clear Improvement: Quantified benefit over traditional methods

If Autoencoder Loses:

Diagnostic Tools: Reconstruction analysis shows what went wrong
Easy Iteration: Modify architecture and re-run comparison
Still Valuable: Learned what doesn't work before investing in complexity

ðŸ”§ Key Parameters to Experiment With

Encoding Dimension: Currently 32, try 16, 64, 128
Architecture Depth: Add more layers to encoder/decoder
Regularization: Adjust dropout rates and batch normalization
Training Strategy: Experiment with epochs and batch sizes

ðŸ“Š Usage Example
# Initialize
autoencoder_baseline = AutoencoderBaseline(
    field_names=['previous_coupon', 'factor', 'previous_factor', 'interest', 'principles', 'date'],
    encoding_dim=32
)

# Run complete pipeline
results = autoencoder_baseline.run_complete_pipeline(
    X_all=X_all,           # All available data (labeled + unlabeled)
    X_labeled=X_labeled,   # Labeled training data
    y_labeled=y_labeled,   # Field change labels
    X_test=X_test,         # Test data
    y_test=y_test          # Test labels
)
This baseline gives you:

Clear answer on whether autoencoders help your specific problem
Solid foundation for advanced techniques if they do help
Diagnostic tools to understand why if they don't help
Production-ready code that handles real-world data challenges
