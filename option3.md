"The ML Lifecycle: Your Map from Idea to Impact"
Slide 1: The Journey Every ML Project Takes
Visual: Circular journey map with stations, showing it's not a one-way trip
Content:

Center text: "ML is a Journey, Not a Destination"
Stations on the circle: Define ‚Üí Collect ‚Üí Prepare ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Improve ‚Üí (back to Define)
Callout: "Average time around the loop: 3-6 months first time, 2-4 weeks for updates"
Bottom stat: "70% of effort happens before and after the model"

Speaking Notes:
"Everyone thinks ML projects are linear - you build a model, deploy it, done. Reality? It's a continuous loop, and the model building is just one stop on this journey. Today I'll walk you through each stage of this lifecycle, show you where projects typically derail, and most importantly, give you the exact questions to ask and support to provide at each stage. By understanding this cycle, you'll know why your engineers are doing what they're doing, when to push, when to be patient, and how to maximize your chances of success. Let's turn you into the PM who actually gets ML projects shipped."

Slide 2: Define - Starting with the End in Mind
Visual: Two paths diverging - one labeled "Build ML for AI's sake" (leads to cliff), other "Solve specific problem" (leads to success)
Content:
The Foundation Stage - Get This Wrong, Everything Fails
What Happens Here:

Translate business pain into ML problem
Define success in numbers, not feelings
Assess if ML is even the right tool

What Usually Goes Wrong:

"We want to use AI" ‚ùå
"Make predictions more accurate" ‚ùå
"Improve customer experience" ‚ùå

What Good Looks Like:

"Reduce false positive alerts by 50% while maintaining 95% catch rate" ‚úÖ
"Predict portfolio risk 3 days out within 5% margin of error" ‚úÖ

Your Power Questions:

"What decision does this help us make?"
"How do we make this decision today?"
"What's the cost of being wrong?"

Your Key Contribution:

Write success criteria in business terms
Document current baseline performance
Set up measuring framework NOW

Red Flag: If you can't measure success, you can't build it
Speaking Notes:
"This is where 40% of ML projects die - bad problem definition. I've seen teams build brilliant models that solve the wrong problem. Last year, a team built an ML model to predict trade volumes. Fantastic 92% accuracy. One problem - traders didn't actually need volume predictions, they needed volatility predictions. Three months wasted. Your role here is crucial - you understand the business problem better than anyone. Write down exactly what success looks like in numbers. 'Improve customer experience' means nothing. 'Reduce customer wait time from 5 minutes to 2 minutes' - that's a target. If your engineers start building before you have clear success metrics, stop them. You'll thank me later."

Slide 3: Collect & Prepare - The Unglamorous Reality
Visual: Pipeline showing raw data transformation: Messy pile ‚Üí Organized blocks ‚Üí Clean dataset
Content:
The Heavy Lifting Stage - Where Time Goes to Hide
Collect Phase (Weeks 1-4):

Find all data sources
Get access permissions (always takes longer)
Understand update frequencies
Check historical depth

Prepare Phase (Weeks 4-8):

Clean missing/corrupt values
Align different formats
Create new calculated fields ("features")
Build data pipelines

What Engineers Call This:

"Feature Engineering" = Creating useful data combinations
"Data Pipeline" = Automated data flow and cleaning

Your Questions to Ask:

"What data do we need vs. what do we have?"
"Who owns this data and have we talked to them?"
"What happens when source data changes?"

How You Can Help:

Fast-track data access approvals
Connect engineers with data owners
Document business rules clearly
Clarify weird data anomalies

Warning Sign: "We're still cleaning data" in week 8 = major problems
Speaking Notes:
"This is where your timeline doubles. Your engineers will spend 60% of the project here, and it'll feel like nothing's happening. They're not being slow - they're doing data archaeology. Example: Our risk prediction model needed trade data. Simple, right? Turns out 'trade value' was stored in USD until 2022, then some genius switched to local currency without telling anyone. Three weeks to figure that out and fix it. You can be a hero here - when engineers need data access, you can cut through bureaucracy faster than they can. When they ask 'why is this field sometimes negative?', you might know it's returns, not losses. Your business context saves weeks of confusion. Feature engineering sounds fancy but it's just creating useful combinations - like calculating 'average trade size per customer' from raw trade data."

Slide 4: Build & Validate - Where the Magic (Finally) Happens
Visual: Split screen - "Build" showing model assembly, "Validate" showing crash test dummy-style testing
Content:
The Exciting Part - But Don't Celebrate Yet
Build Phase (Weeks 8-10):

Try different approaches
Start simple, add complexity
Iterate quickly

What You'll Hear:

"Training the model" = Teaching it patterns
"Hyperparameter tuning" = Adjusting model settings
"Cross-validation" = Testing on different data slices

Validate Phase (Weeks 10-12):

Test on fresh data
Check edge cases
Verify business logic
Test failure modes

Critical Split:

Training Data: 60% (Teaching)
Validation Data: 20% (Tuning)
Test Data: 20% (Final exam)

Your Essential Questions:

"How does it perform on last month's data?"
"What types of cases does it get wrong?"
"What's our confidence in each prediction?"

How to Support:

Provide business context for failures
Review sample predictions for sanity
Identify critical edge cases to test
Define acceptable error rates

üö® Alert: If accuracy suddenly jumps to 99%, something's wrong (data leakage)
Speaking Notes:
"Here's the fun part - building actually takes the least time. Two weeks max. But here's what trips people up: validation. Your model might be 95% accurate on training data but 60% on new data. That's called overfitting - like memorizing answers instead of learning concepts. We had a fraud model that was 98% accurate. Amazing! Then we realized it had learned that all Friday afternoon trades were fraudulent. Why? Our training data only had fraudulent examples from a Friday hack incident. Your role? Be the reality check. Look at what it's predicting and ask 'does this make business sense?' You'll catch issues engineers might miss. When they say cross-validation, they're testing if the model works on different time periods and customer segments - super important for Aladdin where patterns vary across markets."

Slide 5: Deploy - From Lab to Life
Visual: Rocket launch sequence with checkpoints and abort buttons
Content:
The Scary Part - Going Live
Pre-Launch Checklist:

Load testing complete (Can handle 10x volume?)
Rollback plan ready (The undo button)
Monitoring dashboards live
Fallback logic coded
Team trained on response

Deployment Strategies:

Shadow Mode (Weeks 1-2)

Run parallel, don't act on predictions
Compare with current approach


Gradual Rollout (Weeks 3-6)

5% ‚Üí 20% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%
Watch metrics at each step


Feature Flags

Turn on/off instantly
Different models for different users



Terms Decoded:

"A/B Testing" = Running two versions simultaneously
"Canary Deployment" = Testing with small user group first
"Model Endpoint" = Where the model lives and receives requests

Your Critical Questions:

"How do we know if it's failing?"
"Who gets alerted at 2 AM?"
"What's the rollback trigger?"

Your Role:

Prepare stakeholders for gradual rollout
Define go/no-go metrics
Communicate with affected teams
Document early feedback

Speaking Notes:
"Deployment is where good projects become great ones, or where they crash and burn. Never, ever do a big bang deployment. Our portfolio optimizer went live to 100% of users immediately. Worked great for US equities. Asian markets opened, different data pattern, model crashed, $2M in missed opportunities before we could roll back. Now we always do shadow mode first - run the model alongside existing systems without acting on it. This catches 90% of production issues. Gradual rollout is your friend - start with 5% of trades or users, watch for a week, then expand. Your job? Manage expectations. People need to know this is a gradual process. Also, be the voice asking about failure scenarios. Engineers are optimists. You need to be the pessimist asking 'what if everything goes wrong?'"

Slide 6: Monitor & Improve - The Never-Ending Story
Visual: Dashboard with green/yellow/red indicators and trend lines showing model degradation
Content:
The Reality Check - Models Age Like Milk, Not Wine
What to Monitor Daily:

Accuracy trending down? (Model drift)
Input data looks different? (Data drift)
Taking longer to respond? (Performance)
Making weird predictions? (Edge cases)

The Degradation Timeline:

Month 1-3: Works great üìà
Month 4-6: Small accuracy drops üìä
Month 6-12: Needs retraining üìâ
Month 12+: Might need rebuild üîÑ

Terms Explained:

"Model Drift" = World changed, model didn't
"Retraining" = Teaching with new data
"Feature Drift" = Input patterns changed

Your Warning Signs:

Complaints increasing
Metrics trending wrong direction
Lots of manual overrides
"That's weird" happening often

Your Questions:

"How often should we retrain?"
"What triggers an emergency update?"
"Who reviews model decisions?"

How You Help:

Flag unusual business changes
Share user feedback quickly
Approve retraining resources
Plan maintenance windows

Truth: Every model needs updates - plan for it
Speaking Notes:
"Here's what no one tells you - shipping the model is just the beginning. Models degrade. Markets change, customer behavior shifts, regulations update. Our credit risk model was 94% accurate at launch. Six months later? 78%. What happened? COVID changed everything about payment patterns. The model was still predicting based on pre-COVID behavior. Monitor and improve isn't optional - it's survival. You'll hear about model drift - that's when the world changes but your model doesn't. Happens faster than you think. Your superpower here is noticing patterns engineers might miss. Getting more customer complaints? Seeing weird edge cases? Flag them immediately. Also, budget for retraining. It's not a one-time cost. Think of ML models like cars - they need regular maintenance or they break down."

Your Conversation Starters by Stage:

Define: "How will we measure success?"
Collect: "What data access do you need from me?"
Prepare: "What business rules need clarification?"
Build: "Show me examples of predictions"
Validate: "What cases does it struggle with?"
Deploy: "What's our rollback plan?"
Monitor: "How will we know if it's degrading?"

The Three Laws of ML Projects:

It will take 3x longer than the model building
Data quality determines success more than algorithms
Maintenance is mandatory, not optional

Your Superpower: Understanding the business context that makes everything else work
Speaking Notes:
"This is your cheat sheet. Print it, save it, live it. The timeline on top? That's for a medium complexity project with decent data. Multiply by 1.5 for messy data, by 2 for regulated environments. Those conversation starters will make you sound like a seasoned ML product manager. Use them. The three laws? They're immutable. I've never seen exceptions. Your real superpower in this lifecycle isn't understanding the technology - it's being the bridge between business needs and technical execution. You know why something matters, engineers know how to build it. Together, you ship products that actually work. Final thought: ML projects are marathons, not sprints. Pace yourself, celebrate small wins, and remember - every model in production is a victory, even if it's not perfect. Perfect models in development don't help anyone. Good enough models in production change businesses."
