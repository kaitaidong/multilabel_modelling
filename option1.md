Option 4: "Speaking ML: A Translation Guide for Product Managers"
Slide 1: Lost in Translation
Visual: Comic showing PM and engineer talking past each other with speech bubbles full of jargon
Content:

PM: "We need AI to make it smart!"
Engineer: "The F1 score is 0.85 but the AUC-ROC suggests overfitting"
Both: "???"
Title: "Let's Bridge This Gap"
Subtitle: "Your ML-to-English Dictionary for Better Conversations"

Speaking Notes:
"We've all been in this meeting. You ask for AI to improve customer experience, your engineer responds with something about precision-recall curves, and everyone leaves confused. Today, I'm going to give you a translation guide that will transform these conversations. By the end of these 15 minutes, you'll know exactly what your engineers mean, what questions to ask, and most importantly, how to spot when ML metrics don't align with business goals. Let's turn that confusion into collaboration."

Slide 2: The "Accuracy Trap"
Visual: Dashboard showing 95% accuracy but angry customer emails below
Content:
What They Say: "Our model is 95% accurate!"
What It Really Means:

Out of 100 predictions, 95 were correct
But wait... what if 95% of your data is just one category?

Real Aladdin Example:

Trade compliance model: 95% accurate ✅
Reality: 99% of trades are compliant anyway
Model just says "compliant" to everything
Catches 0% of actual violations 😱

The Smart Question to Ask:
"What's the accuracy on just the important cases?"
Better Metrics to Request:

"How many violations do we catch?" (Recall)
"When we flag something, how often are we right?" (Precision)

Speaking Notes:
"This is the most expensive misunderstanding in ML. A model that's 95% accurate sounds amazing, right? But here's a dirty secret - I can build you a 95% accurate model right now for fraud detection. It just says 'not fraud' to everything. If only 5% of transactions are fraudulent, boom, 95% accuracy! Completely useless, but technically accurate. This actually happened with our trade compliance system. The model looked great on paper but caught zero actual violations. Always ask about performance on the rare but important cases - that's what actually matters to your business."

Slide 3: The Performance Trade-off Translator
Visual: Sliders showing trade-offs with business impact labels
Content:
The Three Sliders Every PM Should Understand:
1. Speed vs Accuracy

Fast (1ms): "Good enough" → Real-time trading
Slow (1min): "Very accurate" → Daily risk reports

2. Catching Everything vs Being Sure

Catch-all mode: Flag lots, many false alarms → Fraud detection
High-confidence mode: Flag few, rarely wrong → Auto-execution

3. Explainable vs Powerful

Simple: "Because X > $1M" → Compliance happy
Complex: "Neural network says so" → Better predictions

Your Power Question:
"Which slider matters most for this use case?"
Quick Reference:
If you need...You're choosing...Accept that...Real-timeSpeedLess accurateNo false alarmsPrecisionMiss some casesRegulatory approvalExplainabilitySimpler models
Speaking Notes:
"Think of ML models like camera settings. You can't have everything - fast shutter speed means less light, wide aperture means shallow focus. Same with ML. Want real-time predictions? Accept some errors. Need to catch every violation? Accept false positives. This isn't your engineers being difficult - it's physics. When we built our margin call predictor, PMs wanted real-time, 100% accurate, and fully explainable. Pick two. We chose accurate and explainable, run it every hour. Understanding these trade-offs transforms you from someone making wishes to someone making informed decisions."

Slide 4: Red Flags in ML Conversations
Visual: Warning signs with examples
Content:
🚩 When to Push Back:
They say: "We need more data"
You hear: Standard delay tactic
But check: Do you have <1000 examples? Then they're right
Your response: "What's the minimum data needed to start?"
They say: "The model needs to be retrained"
You hear: More delays
But check: Has performance dropped >10%? Markets changed?
Your response: "How often will this happen in production?"
They say: "We should use deep learning"
You hear: Cool new tech!
But check: Do you have <1M examples? Need explanations?
Your response: "What's the simplest approach that could work?"
They say: "It works in the test environment"
You hear: Ready to ship!
But check: Test data from same time period as training?
Your response: "Show me performance on last month's data"
Green Flags to Look For:
✅ They mention business metrics, not just ML metrics
✅ They have a simple baseline to compare against
✅ They talk about monitoring and maintenance
Speaking Notes:
"These red flags will save your projects. 'We need more data' - sometimes true, often not. I've seen teams collect data for months when they already had enough to start. Ask for specifics. 'It works in test' - biggest red flag ever. Our portfolio optimizer worked perfectly in test because we accidentally trained and tested on the same time period. In production? Disaster. Always ask about out-of-time validation. The deep learning flag? Everyone wants to use the cool stuff. But for 80% of Aladdin use cases, boring algorithms work better. If your engineer jumps straight to complex solutions, that's a warning sign."

Slide 5: Writing Requirements Engineers Love
Visual: Before/after requirement documents
Content:
❌ What Not to Write:
"Use AI to make better trading decisions with high accuracy"
✅ What to Write Instead:
Business Goal: Reduce trade execution costs by 10%
Success Metrics:

Implementation shortfall < 5 basis points
Works for trades $100K - $10M
Decision within 50ms

Data Available:

2 years historical trades (5M records)
Update frequency: Real-time

Constraints:

Must explain why trades were flagged
Needs human override option
Start with US equities only

Nice to Have:

Confidence scores for each decision
Weekly performance reports

Magic Phrase: "What's the simplest solution that achieves this?"
Speaking Notes:
"This slide alone will transform your relationship with engineering. See the difference? The first version is a wish. The second is a blueprint. When you write requirements like this, engineers can actually tell you if it's possible, how long it'll take, and what the challenges are. Notice what's not here - no mention of specific algorithms or technical approaches. That's their domain. Your domain is defining success. The magic phrase at the bottom? It prevents over-engineering. Half the time, you don't even need ML. One PM used this format and discovered they just needed a rules engine, saved 3 months."

Slide 6: The "Is This Even Possible?" Checklist
Visual: Decision tree with business context
Content:
Before You Start Any ML Project, Ask:
1. Do we have historical examples of success/failure?
   No → Stop. You need data first.
   
2. Would a simple rule work almost as well?
   If margin > X, flag it → Maybe don't need ML
   
3. Can we survive if it's wrong 10% of the time?
   No → ML might not be appropriate
   
4. Do we need to know why it made that decision?
   Yes + Regulated → Keep models simple
   
5. How fast do we need answers?
   <10ms → Limits model complexity
   >1 min → More options available
   
6. What happens when (not if) it fails?
   No backup → Design fallback first
The Million Dollar Question:
"What would we do if we didn't have ML?"
(Often, that solution + 20% improvement = good enough)
Speaking Notes:
"This checklist prevents the most common ML disasters. Question 2 is my favorite - would a simple rule work? You'd be amazed how often the answer is yes. Our alert system for large trades? Started as an ML project. Ended as 'if trade > $10M, alert.' Saved months. Question 4 about explainability - critical in finance. If regulators ask why you rejected a trade, 'the neural network said so' doesn't fly. Question 6 about failure - ML will fail. Networks go down, data corrupts, markets go crazy. If you don't have a plan B, you don't have a plan. Always design the fallback first, then add ML as an enhancement."

Slide 7: Your Conversation Toolkit
Visual: Pocket reference card design
Content:
Your Power Questions:

"What happens if we're wrong?" → Reveals risk understanding
"How do we know it's working?" → Forces measurable success
"What's the simplest version?" → Prevents over-engineering
"How often does this pattern change?" → Uncovers maintenance needs
"Show me where this has failed" → Tests robustness

Phrases That Build Trust:

"What would success look like from your perspective?"
"What concerns you most about this approach?"
"Help me understand the trade-offs"

Your 30-Second Elevator Pitch:
"We want to [business goal], we're seeing [current problem], success means [specific metric], we have [data available], and we need this by [timeline]. What's the simplest approach?"
Remember: You don't need to know how ML works. You need to know what it can and can't do for your business.
Speaking Notes:
"Last slide - your takeaway toolkit. Screenshot this. These five questions will make you sound like you've been doing ML for years. They force clarity and expose hidden assumptions. The trust-building phrases? They change dynamics from adversarial to collaborative. Engineers want to help, but they need clear targets. That 30-second pitch at the bottom? It's gotten more ML projects approved than any technical presentation. You're not asking for AI or ML specifically - you're presenting a problem and asking for solutions. Half the time, the best solution isn't even ML. And that's perfectly fine. Remember: your superpower isn't understanding algorithms - it's understanding what the business needs and translating that into clear requirements."
